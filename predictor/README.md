# Beta 4 state predictor
# Introduction
Predictor that takes ASCII PSSM generated by psi-blast as input and predict the four states in the represented by each amino-acid in sequence; that are :- i,o,P,L.

# Instructions

  - Create a [ASCII] PSSM using PSI-BLAST. The script will accept any valid PSSM file with name pssm.txt
  - Just run the script [predict.py] with the pssm.txt in the directory. There is a sample file included
  - Make sure that the scikit-learn package and numpy is installed

Output:
  - A succesful run should result in 5 different files:
  - output_all.txt - It predicts all the states using classifier file All.pkl
  - output_i.txt - It predicts only i state using classifier file i.pkl
  - output_o.txt - It predicts only o state using classifier file o.pkl
  - output_L.txt - It predicts only L state using classifier file L.pkl
  - output_P.txt - It predicts only P state using classifier file P.pkl
